This pet project is made in honor of the iconic game Cyberpunk 2077. It incorporates a lot of advanced layout techniques and libraries. The project showcases my skills in advanced web development, as well as my proficiency in React and TypeScript.

This project was built using React and TypeScript. It also utilizes ReactRouter for routing, Swiper js library for practical sliders  and various React Hooks for component management and interaction.
